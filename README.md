## Dataset

The data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others

### Project Output

In this explanatory study, we tend to study and address the following questions:
> What factors affect a loan’s outcome status?
> What affects the borrower’s APR or interest rate?
> Are there differences between loans depending on how large the original loan amount was?

* The results are in graphs formats.

<lu>
    <li> Lend Yield
    <li> Estimated Effective Yield
    <li> Estimated Loss
    <li> Estimated Return
</lu>

## Key Insights for Presentation
